## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to manage state transitions efficiently by using the React hook [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer).

I also learned the basics of the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework, how to create custom classes (for colors, font size, or any CSS property) using the **extend** feature. With this, i was able to create three themes that users can select.
